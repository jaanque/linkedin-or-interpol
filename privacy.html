        <h2 data-i18n-key="googleSignalsHeader">Google Signals Data Collection</h2>
        <p data-i18n-key="googleSignalsText1">
            If you activate Google Signals, you will allow Google Analytics to collect data about your traffic, in addition to the data it already collects through the standard implementation of Google Analytics, to offer you more features. Google Signals will not be included in the identity for Google Analytics reports.
        </p>
        <p data-i18n-key="googleSignalsText2">
            When Google Signals is activated, Google Analytics will collect visit information and associate it with information that Google already has from the accounts of users who have logged in and authorized this association to see personalized ads. Google's information may include the location of end-users, search history, YouTube history, and data from sites that are associated with Google. By activating Google Signals, you agree to comply with Google's Advertising Features policy, including the rules on sensitive categories; you also confirm that end-users have granted you the relevant private information disclosure rights and permissions to make this association, and that such users can access and delete that data through the My Activity page.
        </p>
        <p data-i18n-key="googleSignalsText3">
            Google Signals data collection is allowed in 307 of 307 territories.
        </p>
        <p data-i18n-key="googleSignalsText4">
            Note: If you use the switch above to enable this feature, Google Analytics will automatically collect additional information about your traffic to provide additional user statistics and enable the option to share audiences. If you do not want to collect Google Signals data, disable this feature with the switch and check that you have not manually enabled Remarketing and Advertising Reporting Features in your Google Analytics tags.
        </p>

            Improve measurement and enable additional features with your Google Ads integrations. With User-ID and user-provided data, you can use your own data to know how users interact with your website and your applications, improve conversion measurement, and complement audience sharing features if you link your Analytics property with Google Ads accounts.

        </p>
        <p data-i18n-key="userIdText5">
            The User-ID feature allows you to provide your own identifiers to users of your site and application so that you can relate their behavior in different sessions, as well as on the different devices and platforms from which they visit you. Google Analytics interprets each user ID as an independent user, which provides you with more accurate user counts and a more complete view of each user's interactions with your company. More information about User-ID.
        </p>
        <p data-i18n-key="userIdText6">
            You are responsible for using the User-ID feature in accordance with the Google Analytics Terms of Service. This includes not sending personally identifiable information to Google Analytics as a User-ID and adequately notifying the use of identifiers in your privacy policy. See how to send user IDs to Google Analytics in Send user IDs.

        <p data-i18n-key="userIdText10">
            This will improve user and conversion measurement by providing you with more detailed audience data. To use features such as improved conversion measurement and audience sharing, you must have linked advertising accounts and ad personalization activated in your Google Analytics property. The collection of user-provided data complements the data you already have from Google Analytics, as it allows you to send consented and hash-encrypted customer data to Google Analytics without violating their privacy. More information about the collection of user-provided data.
        </p>
        <p data-i18n-key="userIdText11">
            By activating the collection of user-provided data, you confirm that you comply with the policy of the user-provided data feature and the requirement to have the necessary privacy notices and rights of end-users for such use.

        <h2 data-i18n-key="granularDataHeader">Granular Location and Device Data Collection</h2>
        <p data-i18n-key="granularDataText1">
            When you activate the collection of granular location and device data, Analytics collects metadata about the city-level location and granular details about the devices of your site visitors and app users to offer location and device-based features.
        </p>
        <p data-i18n-key="granularDataText2">
            The collection of granular location and device data is allowed in 307 of 307 territories.
        </p>
        <p data-i18n-key="granularDataText3">
            Territory and country-level metadata is collected by default in relation to all your traffic to comply with territorial privacy policies and for territory-based Analytics settings to work. For more information about location and device data collection settings, see the article Collect granular location and device data.

        <h2 data-i18n-key="adPersonalizationHeader">Advanced Settings to Allow Ad Personalization</h2>
        <p data-i18n-key="adPersonalizationText1">
            When ad personalization is enabled, you can export your Google Analytics audiences and key events to your linked Google Ads accounts to offer relevant and personalized experiences to your end-users.
        </p>
        <p data-i18n-key="adPersonalizationText2">
            Ads can be personalized in 307 of 307 regions.
        </p>
        <p data-i18n-key="adPersonalizationText3">
            You can configure Google Analytics at the property level to collect data for ad personalization and measurement purposes, in relation to the use of features such as Google Signals, User-ID, and ad integrations, or if you enable the option to share data with Google. If you disable ad personalization, shared remarketing lists will be marked as inactive and new users will not be shared through remarketing lists. In addition, the exported data (whether audiences exported through an integration or data shared through the Google products and services sharing option) will not be used to personalize ads. More information.
        </p>
        <p data-i18n-key="adPersonalizationText4">
